## About this Project
-Every programmer, no matter their language uses code snippets and code editors. 

-Due to this, i was tasked with compiling a text editor into a PWA that allows any programmer to save and download code snippets on an app that works online and offline like google docs.

-Thanks to this, any developer that wants to save, write or paste his code on a note app, can instead do it on this text editor specifically made to store code.

This project uses the following dependencies.
[concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) run multiple commands concurrently
[express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) fast minimalist web framework
[code-mirror-themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/code-mirror-themes) online editor themes
[idb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/idb) indexed db
